# Tools And Libraries

This skill is intentionally “raw HTTP first” (so an agent can be precise about endpoints, auth, and parameters).

## Common prompts this helps with

- “Is there an official SDK?”
  - Yes—see the docs below for official SDKs and tooling.
- “Should my autonomous agent use an SDK?”
  - If you’re building a production integration, an SDK can simplify OAuth + retries.
  - If you’re building an agent that needs maximum transparency and debuggability, curl-style HTTP requests are often easier to reason about.
